\chapter{Theoretical Background}
\label{theoretical_background}

\par The \acrfull{sm} of particle physics represents the sum of
knowledge of the fundamental particles and their interactions with
each other.  It is a \acrfull{qft} that represents the interactions of each of the
fundamental forces through the symmetry of a mathematical object
known as a Lie group.  It is the theory that dictates the rate that
the~\ttH~process is produced, as well as the kinematics of every
particle involved.  As such, its predictions are critical for modeling
the charateristic signature of the~\ttH~signal in the \acrshort{cms}
detector, as well as the background processes, like~\ttbb~which leave
a kinematically similar final state signature.     


\section{An Overview of Quantum Field Theory}
\label{qft_overview}

\par \acrfull{qft} was developed out of the need for a
relativistic description of quantum mechanics.  Since the Einstein
relation $E=mc^{2}$ allows for the creation of particle-antiparticle
pairs, the single-particle description used in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, fails describe this phenomenom~\cite{Peskin_Schroeder}.
This additionally fails when considering that Heisenberg's uncertainty
relation, $\Delta~E\cdot~\Delta~t = \hbar$, allows for an arbitrary
number of intermediate, virtual particles to be created.  By
quantizing a field representing a certain type of particle,
multiparticle states are naturally described as discreet excitations
of that field.  

% Lorentz invariance reveals a relationship between matter/antimatter
\par Lorentz invariance, and the need to preserve causality, also define a
fundamental relationship between matter and antimatter.  The
propagation of a particle across a space-like interval is treated
equivalently to the an anti-particle propagating in the opposite
direction~\cite{Peskin_Schroeder}.  This is done so that the net
probability amplitude for the particles to have an effect on a 
measurment occuring accross a space-like interval cancel each other,
thus preserving cuasality.  This cancellation requirement additionally
implies that the particle and anti-particle have the same mass, with
opposite quantum numbers such as spin or electric charge.   

% Accounting for spin 
\par The Lorentz transformations for a scalar field are different than
for a field with internal degrees of freedom, such as spin.  A
rotation on a vector field, will affect both its location, as well as
it's orentation~\cite{Peskin_Schroeder}.  This means the Lorentz
invariant equation of motion descirbing a scalar field will have a
different form than equations of motion for a field with spin.  The
most relevant equations describe the particles of \acrshort{sm}, which
contain spins of 0, 1/2, and 1.  They are described by the
Klein-Gordan, Dirac, and Proca equations respectively. \\

\noindent Klein-Gordon equation, for scalar (spin 0) fields 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:klein_gordon_eom}
(\partial^{2} + m^{2})\phi = 0  
\end{equation} 

\noindent Dirac equation, for spinor (spin 1/2) fields 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_eom}
(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} - m)\psi = 0 
\end{equation} 

\noindent Proca equation, for vector (spin 1) fields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:proca_eom}
\partial_{\mu}(\partial^{\mu}A^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu}A^{\mu}) + m^{2}A^{\nu}
= 0 
\end{equation} 

% From the free fields to interactions
\par With these equations, one can build a theory of free particles.
The Lagrangian formulation is the most appropriate since all
expressions are explicitly Lorentz invariant~\cite{Peskin_Schroeder}.
The Lagrangians for the Klein-Gordon, Dirac, and Proca equations are
given as: \\

\noindent Klein-Gordon Lagrangian, for real and complex scalar fields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:klein_gordon_lagrangian}
\begin{aligned}
& \mathcal{L} = \partial_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\phi^{2} - \frac{1}{2}m^{2}\phi^{2}  \\
& \mathcal{L} = (\partial_{\mu}\phi)^{\ast}(\partial^{\mu}\phi) - m^{2}(\phi)^{\ast}(\phi) 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent Dirac Lagrangian, for spinor fields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L} = i\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi - m\bar{\psi}\psi 
\end{equation}

\noindent Proca Lagrangian, for vector fields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:proca_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + m^{2}A^{\nu}A_{\mu} 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $F_{\mu\nu}$, is the field strength tensor, defined as
$F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu} - \partial{\nu}A_{\mu}$

\par Interactions are generated by coupling multiple fields together in a
single term, such as $ieA_{\mu}\bar{\psi}\psi$ and treating it as a
perturbation to the free field theory.  This implies every interaction
between particles is carried out by a virtual mediating particle.  When two
electrons scatter off one another, they are really exchanging a
virtual photon, the mediator of the electromagnetic force.  The
$W^{\pm} and Z$ bosons mediate the weak force, while the $gluons$
mediate the strong force.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lagrangian_free_interacting}
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{Free} + \mathcal{L}_{Interacting}
\end{equation}

% Feynmann rules provide the method of calculating physical observables
\par In order to calculate the probability and dynamics of two
particles interacting with one another, an integral, constrained by
energy and momentum conservation, over the phase space of outgoing
particles and the scattering amplitude, $mathcal{M}$, is evaluated.
The scattering amplitude is calculated by using the propagtor (Green's
function of the free particle theory) for the incoming, mediating, and
outgoing particles, with an appropriate wieghting function, or vertex
factor, for each point the particles interact in the scattering
process, and then integrating over the momentum of the mediating
particle.  Richard Feynmann developed a set of rules for the writing
down the propagators and vertex factors directly from the Lagrangian,
and easily computing the scattering amplitude.  He also introduced an
elegant pictographic notation useful for visualizing particle
interactions, known as Feynmann diagrams.

\par With these tools, one can calculate the probability amplitudes of
a given process occuring to \acrfull{lo} without any
difficulties.  However, when calculations in \acrfull{nlo} are
performed, and loop diagrams of virtual particles are considered, the
probability amplitudes associated with a given process diverge to
infinity.  This occurs when one integrates over all of the 
possible momentum allowed by intermediate, loops of virtual particles,
which due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, are allowed to take
on any value of momentum.  Figure
\ref{fig:feynman_diagrams_ee_scattering} shows an example of a
\acrshort{lo} and \acrshort{nlo} process.

\end{figure}

\par The systematic removal of divergences from a theory is called
renormalization.  The divergences are absorbed into the
definitions of the free parameters of the theory, making the parameters a function of
the energy scale the process occurs at, instead of a constant.  This
allows for the calculations of fundamental processes to completed,
as long as the energy scale of the interaction is known.  A modern
interpretation of renormalization was provided by Kenneth
Wilson~\cite{th:Wilson_renormalization1}~\cite{th:Wilson_renormalization2}.
Instead of seeing the effects of high momentum calculations after
moving to \acrshort{nlo} in perturbation theory, one uses an effective Lagrangian,
computed by integrating out shells of momentum beginning at the energy
cutoff of the theory, where the \acrshort{nlo} effects begin the
dominate.  The dimensions of integration are then rescaled and the
result of evaluating the integral over the momentum shell is absorbed
into the definition of free parameters.  The processes is iterated
until the energy scale of the interaction is reached.  The functional 
dependence of the parameters is then  directly present in the resulting
effective Lagrangian, instead of appearing suddenly when accounting
for the one-loop contributions at \acrshort{nlo}.  Regardless of how
strange this procedure seem, the running of the coupling constant as a
function of interaction engergy has been validated experimentally time
and time and again, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:globalAvgAlphaS}~\cite{Bethke_WorldAvgAlphaS_QCD}.


\section{Abelian Gauge Theories of Particle Interactions}
\label{abelian_gauge_theory_overview}

\par In 1930, Herman Weyl introduced the idea that the interactions
between fields can be generated by requiring them to be invariant
under guage tansformations of a local symmetry~\cite{Weyl}.  For
electromagnetism, the local symmetry is that of the Lie group,
$U(1)$.  It is an abelian group, which has the property that the
generators of the group symmetry commutes with themselves. 
The $U(1)$ symmetry is invariant under phase rotations.  By requiring
local guage invariance, the Lagrangian must be unchanged under the 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:u1_psi_transformation}
\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{i\alpha(x)}\psi(x).
\end{equation}

Consider the Lagrangian for a free spin 1/2 particle: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dirac_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} - m)\psi
\end{equation}

\noindent The first term in the Lagrangian, involving the derivative,
acts on $\alpha(x)$, creating a new term in the Lagrangian, breaking
its invariance under the local phase transformation.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:u1_lagrangian_transformation}
\mathcal{L}\rightarrow\mathcal{L} -
(\partial_{\mu}\alpha)\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi
\end{equation}

\noindent Thus, a new term must be added to the orginial Lagrangian to cancel
out the term arising from the local phase transformation.  This is
achieved by defining the covariant derivative:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:covariant_derivative_em}
D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ieA_{\mu}
\end{equation} 

\noindent where $A_{\mu}$ is a new vector field that transforms as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:u1_Afield_transformation}
A_{\mu}(x) \rightarrow A_{\mu}(x) - \frac{1}{e}\partial_{\mu}\alpha(x)
\end{equation}

\noindent The covariant derivative thus transforms like

\begin{equation}\label{eq:u1_covariant_derivative_transformation}
\begin{aligned}
D_{\mu}\psi(x) & \rightarrow [ \partial_{\mu} + ie(A_{\mu} -
\frac{1}{e}\partial_{\mu}\alpha) ]e^{i\alpha(x)}D_{\mu}\psi(x) \\
& = e^{i\alpha(x)}[ \partial_{\mu} + ie(A_{\mu} -
\frac{1}{e}\partial_{\mu}\alpha + \frac{1}{e}\partial_{\mu}\alpha) ]D_{\mu}\psi(x) \\
 & = e^{i\alpha(x)}(\partial_{\mu} + ieA_{\mu})\psi(x) \\
 & = e^{i\alpha(x)}D_{\mu}\psi(x)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent This covariant derivative transforms in the smae way that $\psi(x)$
does, and the new locally guage invariant Lagrangian becomes

\begin{equation}\label{eq:u1_invariant_lagrangian}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L} & = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu} - m)\psi - \frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} \\
& = i\bar{\psi}\gamma\partial_{\mu}\psi -
\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi~A_{mu} - m\bar{\psi}\psi -
\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where

\begin{equation}\label{eq:u1_field_strength_tensor}
F^{\mu\nu} = (\partial^{\mu}A^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu}A^{\mu})
\end{equation}

\noindent and $\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu} $ is the kinetic energy
term of the Proca equation for the new vector field.

\par This new Lagrangian is identical to the \acrshort{qed}
Lagrangian, excpet it was derived beginning with a free dirac theory
and requiring the field to be locally guage invariant under $U(1)$
transformations.  This necessitated the introduction of a new vector
field, $A_{\mu}$, as well as an interaction term with it.  This
implies that the electromagnetic force can be represented by the
requirement of local $U(1)$ symmetry on a free Dirac particle.  

\par It should be noted, that if the photon had mass, an additional
term from the Proca equation would have to be added to the Lagrangian,
$m^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu}$.  This term complicates the picture since it is
not invariant under local phase transformations, and cannot be
compensated for through a different choice of $A_{\mu}$.  This implies
that the bosons of a guage theory must be massless in order to
preserve local guage invariance.  


\section{Non-Abelian Gauge Theories of Particle Interactions}
\label{non_abelian_gauge_theory_overview}
\par In 1954, Yang and Mills worked to extend this idea to symmetries
of different guage groups~\cite{th:Yang_Mills}.  Their most imortant
accomplishment was developing this procedure for non-abelian groups.
These are groups, where the transformation does not involve a simple
variable $\alpha(x)$, but rather an entire matrix of dimension n$>$2.
These matrices do no commute with each other, and their work developed
the procedure for applying local guage invariance described above to
the more complex, higher dimensional symmetries, such as $SU(2)$ and
$SU(3)$.  Consider the case of $SU(2)$ symmetry.  The theory is
appropriate for describing the dynamics of two fermion fields,
represented as a doublet:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_fermion_doublet}
\psi = \binom{\psi_{1}(x)}{\psi_{2}(x)}
\end{equation}

\noindent this will transform under the $SU(2)$ transformation as a
two-component spinor:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_fermion_transformaiton}
\psi \rightarrow \text{ exp}\langle~i\alpha^{i}\frac{\sigma_{i}}{2}\rangle\psi
\end{equation} 

\noindent where $\sigma^{i}$ are the Pauli matrices:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pauli_matrices}
\sigma^{1} = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &  1 \\
    1  &  0
  \end{pmatrix}
\text{   ,    }
\sigma^{2} = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  & -i \\
    i  &  0
  \end{pmatrix}
\text{   ,   }
\sigma^{3} = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1  &   0 \\
    0  & -1
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent and have the commutation relation defined by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pauli_matrices_commutator}
[\frac{\sigma^{i}}{2}\text{, }\frac{\sigma^{j}}{2}] =
i\epsilon^{ijk}\frac{\sigma^{k}}{2}
\end{equation}

\par Similar to the case of the $U(1)$ Abelian symmetry, in order to form
a lagrangian that is locally guage invariant, three vector fields,
$A_{\mu}^{i}$, $i=1,2,3$, are introduced, and coupled to $\psi$
through the covariant derivative:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_covariant_derivative}
D_{\mu} = (\partial_{\mu} - igA_{\mu}^{i}\frac{\sigma^{i}}{2})
\end{equation}

\noindent to ensure that the derivative covaries with the
transformation, the fields, $A_{\mu}^{i}$ will transform like:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_vector_field_transformation}
A_{\mu}^{i}\frac{\sigma^{i}}{2} \rightarrow
A_{\mu}^{i}\frac{\sigma^{i}}{2} +
\frac{1}{g}(\partial_{\mu}\alpha^{i})\frac{\sigma
^{i}}{2} +
i[\frac{\alpha^{i}\sigma{i}}{2}\text{,
}A_{\mu}^{i}\frac{\sigma^{i}}{2}]
\end{equation}

\noindent The third term, which was absent from the abelian form of
the transformation, is necessary to account for the non-commutation of
the pauli matrices.  This non-communtation also changes the form of
the field strength tensor, $F_{\mu\nu}^{i}$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_field_strength_tensor}
F_{\mu\nu}^{i} = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}^{i} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}^{i} + g\epsilon^{ijk}A_{\mu}^{j}A_{\nu}^{k}
\end{equation}

\noindent The entire $SU(2)$ invariant Lagrangian can then be written
as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_invariant_lagrangian}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{Yang-Mills} & = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{i}F^{i\mu\nu} +
\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu})\psi \\
 & = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{i}F^{i\mu\nu} +
\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} -
igA_{\mu}^{i}\frac{\sigma^{i}}{2})\psi
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\par This procedure generalizes to any continuous group of
symmetries.  The basic steps involve identrifying the generators of
the transformation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_general_transformation}
\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{i\alpha^{a}t^{a}} \psi
\end{equation}

\noindent where $t^{a}$ are a set of matrices with the commutation
relationship:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_general_commutator}
[t^{a} \text{, } t^{b}]  = if^{abc}t^{c}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f^{abc}$ is the structure constant for the goup.  The
covariant derivative is then defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_general_covariant_derivative}
D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} - igA_{\mu}^{a}t^{a}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the fields, $A_{\mu}^{a}$, transform like:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_general_vector_transformation}
A_{\mu}^{a} \rightarrow A_{\mu}^{a} +
\frac{1}{g}\partial_{\mu}\alpha^{a} + f^{abc}A_{\mu}^{b}\alpha^{c}
\end{equation}

\noindent the field strength tensor is then formed as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_general_field_strength_tensor}
F_{\mu\nu}^{a} = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}^{a} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}^{a}
+ f^{abc}A_{\mu}^{b}A_{\nu}^{c}
\end{equation}

\noindent and finally, the locally, gauge invariant Lagrangian will
have the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:yang_mills_general_invariant_lagrangian}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{General, non-Abelian}} & =
  -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{a}F^{a\mu\nu} +
  \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu})\psi \\
& = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{a}F^{a\mu\nu} +
  \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu} - igA_{\mu}^{a}t^{a})\psi 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\par In 1964, Murray Gell-Mann and Zweig independtly developed a model
of hadron interactions, that described the spectrum of baryons and
mesons in terms of combinations of fundamental particles, which
Gell-Mann named
quarks~\cite{th:GellMann_QuarkModel}~\cite{th:Zweig_QuarkModel1}~\cite{th:Zweig_QuarkModel2}.
In their model, three quarks: $u, d, s$ formed an $SU(3)$ flavor
symmetry.  However, this did not explain the appearance of only two
and three quark combinations, the mesons and baryons.  It also could
not explain the spin statistics of the baryons.  The $\Delta^{++}$,
$\Delta^{-}$, and $\Omega^{-}$, particles all have $uuu$, $ddd$, $sss$
quark combinations, respectively, with their spins aligned.  That is
to say, these baryons seem to violate the Pauli-exclusion prinicple
since all three quarks seem to occupy the same quantum state
simultaneously.   

\par  In 1964, O.W. Greenberg solved this problem by proposing that quarks also have
an additional quantum number, $color$, that come in three types: red,
green, blue~\cite{th:Greenberg_color}.  The requirement that all
stable hadrons be color neutral: either possessing equal amounts of
all three colors in $qqq$ combinations, or a $q\bar{q}$ pair sharing the
same color, also explained the observation of only 2 and 3 quark
combinations in experiments.  These three colors form an
$SU(3)$ symmetry, and is the gauge symmetry describing the
interactions of quarks and leptons.  This theory is known as
\acrfull{qcd}.  Its derivation follows from the procedure outlined
above.  This group has eight generators, kown as the Gell-Mann
matrices, and are defined as: 

\tiny
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gell_man_matrices}
\begin{aligned}
& t^{1} = \frac{1}{2}

\noindent and a Lagrangian defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:qcd_lagrangian}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{QCD} & = -\frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}^{a}G^{a\mu\nu} +
\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu}) \\
 & = -\frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}^{a}G^{a\mu\nu} +
\bar{\psi}(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}-igA_{\mu}^{a}t^{a})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $t^{a}$ are the Gell-Mann matrices defined in
equation~\ref{eq:gell_man_matrices} and the fields $A_{\mu}^{a}$ are
the eight mediators of the \acrshort{qcd} force, the $gluons$.  

\par Like all non-abelian guage theories, it is asymptotically
free.  Thus, the strength of the coupling constant,
$\alpha_{s}$, decreases as the momentum-transfer, $Q$ in interaction
increases.  This allows the use of perturbation theory for
high-momentum calculations, therefore allowing calculations of
hadronic-processes for experimental evaluation.    

\par The idea of local guage invariance was successful in describing
the dynamics of \acrshort{qed} and \acrshort{qcd}, which only contain
massless guage bosons. Theorists had long postulated that
the weak force was so weak because it was being facilitated by massive
bosons, but adding a mass term for a boson breaks the local guage
invariance.  So, a tool was needed to reconcile the concept of local guage
invariance, which works so well for the other forces, with the
prospect of the weak force being facilitated by massive guage bosons.


\section{The Higgs Mechanism in an Abelian Theory}
\label{abelian_higgs_mechanism_overview}

\par In 1964 Peter Higgs introduced the idea that the guage bosons
can acquire their mass through the breaking of an underlying
symemtry~\cite{th:Higgs_BrokenSymmetries}. In other words, the natural
symmetry of the Lagrangian describing a particular interaction could
be different than the symmetry we observe in nature.  Consider an
abelian example of complex scalar field theory, coupled to itself and
to an electromagnetic field~\cite{Peskin_Schroeder}. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}(F_{\mu\nu})^{2} + |D_{\mu}\phi|^{2} -
V(\phi)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + ieA_{\mu}$, is the familiar
coviarant derivative, and the Lagrangian is invariant under the $U(1)$
transformation as described earlier.  The potential term, $V(\phi)$
has the form

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_potential}
V(\phi) = -\mu^{2}\phi^{\ast}\phi +
\frac{\lambda}{2}(\phi^{\ast}\phi)^{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
   \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Basic_Diagrams/higgs-potential.pdf}
  \caption{A visual representation of the Higgs potential} \label{fig:higgs_potential}
\end{figure}

\noindent if $\mu^{2}>0$ the shape of the potential no longer has a
mimium at $\langle\phi\rangle = 0$.  Figure \ref{fig:higgs_potential}
shows a plot of the potential energy of $\phi$ in terms of each of its
components.  The new minimum potential energy
occurs at:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_potential_min}
\langle\phi\rangle = \phi_{0} = \left(\frac{\mu^{2}}{\lambda}\right)^{1/2}
\end{equation}

\noindent and while the field has a ground state at the zero potential
point it is in an unstable equilibrium.  Any quantum fluctuation about
this point will take the field into the lower energy configuration
with a ground state about the new minimum.  When the Langrangian is
expanded about~\ref{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_potential_min}, the
field, $\phi$ is rewritten as: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_expanded_phi}
\phi(x) = \phi_{0} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\phi_{1}(x) + i\phi_{2}(x)
\end{equation}

\noindent the potential term, $V(x)$, then becomes:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_expanded_pot}
V(x) = -\frac{1}{2\lambda}\mu^{4} +
\frac{1}{2}\cdot2\mu^{2}\phi_{1}^{2} + \mathcal{O}(\phi_{i}^{3})
\end{equation}

\noindent where we can notice that $\phi_{1}$ has acquired a mass term
with, $m = \sqrt{2}\mu$, while the scalar field $\phi_{2}$ remains
massless, and is known as the Goldstone boson.  The covariant
derivative is also tranformed as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_expanded_covDer}
|D_{\mu}\phi|^{2} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}\phi_{1})^{2} +
\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}\phi_{2})^{2} +
\sqrt{2}e\phi_{0}\cdot~A_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\phi_{2} +
e^{2}\phi_{0}^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu} + ...
\end{equation}

\noindent where cubic and quartic terms of $A_{\mu}$, $\phi_{1}$,
and $\phi_{2}$ have been dropped.  The important term is the last one,
which can be interpreted as a mass term of the vector field, $A_{\mu}$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_mass_term_Amu}
\Delta\mathcal{L}_{M} =
  \frac{1}{2}m_{A}A_{\mu}A^{\mu} = e^{2}\phi_{0}^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $m_{A} = 2e^{2}\phi_{0}^{2}$, has arisen from
consequences of a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the $\phi$
field.  The remaining, massless Godlstone boson, $\phi_{2}$ is not a
physical particle, but rather a consequence of the choice of guage.
This is illustrated when we can use the $U(1)$ guage symmetry to rotate
the field $\phi(x)$ such that the field disapears.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_rotate_phi2}
\begin{aligned}
 \phi \rightarrow \phi' & = e^{i\alpha}(\phi_{1} + \phi_{2}) \\
& = (\cos{\alpha} + i\sin{\alpha})(\phi_{1} + \phi_{2}) \\
& = (\phi_{1}\cos{\alpha} - \phi_{2}\sin{\alpha}) +
i(\phi_{1}\sin{\alpha} + \phi_{2}\cos{\alpha}) \\
& = (\phi_{1} - \phi_{2}\tan{\alpha}) + i(\phi_{1}\tan{\alpha} +
\phi_{2})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent Choosing $\alpha = -\tan{\phi_{2}/\phi_{1}}$ will make $\phi'$
 a real quantity and elminate it's imaginary component, $\phi_{2}'$.
 The lagrangian can then be rewritten in terms of the rotated field
 $\phi'$ and see that massless boson is indeed removed from the
 theory.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:abelian_higgs_mechanism_final_lagrangian}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L} & =
\frac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}\phi_{1}')(\partial^{\mu}\phi_{1}') -
\frac{1}{2}\cdot~2\mu^{2}\phi_{1}'\phi_{1}' \\
&  -\frac{1}{4}(F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}) +
\frac{1}{2}\cdot~e^{2}\phi_{0}^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\nu} \\
&  + \phi_{0}e^{2}\phi_{1}'A_{\mu}A^{\mu} +
\frac{1}{2}e^2\phi_{1}'^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu} + \mathcal{O}(\phi'^{3})...
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\par The degree of freedom that $\phi_{2}$ represents, is absorbed as
a longitudanal polarization of the $A_{mu}$ field, a forbidden for
massless guage bosons, but necessary for massive bosons.  

\par For this case of an abelian symmetry $U(1)$, it was shown that if a
complex scalar field, which interacts with itself and another vector
field, can gains a non-zero vacuum expectation value.  The Lagrangian can
be expanded about this new mimimum, generating a mass term for the
vector field.  One of the degrees of freedom of the orginial complex
scalar field is then absorbed as a longitudanal polarization state of
the massive vector field.  

\section{The Higgs Mechanism in a non-Abelian Theory}
\label{non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_overview}

\par Before describing the elctroweak guage theory of
$SU(2)\otimes~U(1)$, it will be helpful to see the effects of the
Higgs mechanism for the non-Abelian group, $SU(2)$ by itself.  Consider an
an example of an $SU(2)$ gauge field coupled to a scalar field that
transforms like a real-valued vector under $SU(2)$
transformations~\cite{Peskin_Schroeder}.  The field $\phi$ will have
the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_phi}
\phi = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \phi_{1} \\
    \phi_{2} \\
    \phi_{3}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the components, $\phi_{i}$ are real-valued fields.
The $SU(2)$ transformation for this scalar field will also look like:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_transformation}
\phi \rightarrow e^{i\alpha^{i}T^{i}}\phi
\end{equation}

\noindent where the matrices, $T^{i}$ are defined as:

\tiny
\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_generators}
iT^{1} = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &  0  &  0 \\
    0  &  0  &  1 \\
    0  & -1 &  0 
  \end{pmatrix}
\text{   ,    }
T^{2} = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &  0  & -1 \\
    0  &  0  &  0 \\
    1  &  0  &  0 \\ 
  \end{pmatrix}
\text{   ,   }
T^{3} = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &   1  &  0 \\
   -1 &   0  &  0 \\
    0  &   0  &  0
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\normalsize

\noindent The Lagrangian for this field will feature a Higgs potential
term along with the previously mentioned $SU(2)$ guage fields, $A_{\mu}^{a}$ coupled
to the scalar field, $phi$, and is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}^{a}F^{a\mu\nu}+ |D_{\mu}\phi|^{2}
+ \mu^{2}\phi^{\ast}\phi - \frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi^{\ast}\phi)^{2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $F_{\mu}{\nu}^{a}$, the field strength tensor is
defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_field_strength_tensor}
F_{\mu\nu}^{a} = (\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}^{a}
- \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}^{a}) + g\epsilon^{abc}A_{\mu}^{b}A_{\nu}^{c}
\end{equation}

\noindent and the covariant derivative is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_covariant_derivative}
D_{\mu} = (\partial_{\mu} + igA_{\mu}^{a}T^{a})\phi
\end{equation}

\par Similarly to the Abelian case, the Higgs potential will induce a
spontaneous symmetry breaking, and one of the components of the field
$\phi$ will gain a vacuum expectation value.  After this breaking and
expanding around the ground state potential, the
field $\phi$ will have the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_phi_broken}
\phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    v + h
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent There has been no loss in generality in assuming this form
since, similarly to the abelian case, we can use the gauge symmetry of
$SU(2)$ to rotate the field into this configuration.  Goldstone's
theorem tells us that we should expect two massive gague bosons
corresponding to the $T^{1}$, and $T^{2}$ generators, while the
$T^{3}$ generator will correspond to a massless gauge boson, since
$\phi$ is still invariant under $T^{3}$ transformations. 

\par As in the Abelian case, the mass terms for the gauge bosons are
generated from the covariant derivative term, $|D_{\mu}\phi|^{2}$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_covariant_derivative_on_phi}
\begin{aligned}
D_{\mu}\phi & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(~\partial_{\mu} + gA_{\mu}^{1}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &  0  &  0 \\
    0  &  0  &  1 \\
    0  & -1 &  0 
  \end{pmatrix}
  + gA_{\mu}^{2}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &  0  & -1 \\
    0  &  0  &  0 \\
    1  &  0  &  0 \\ 
  \end{pmatrix}
+ gA_{\mu}^{3}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &   1  &  0 \\
   -1 &   0  &  0 \\
    0  &   0  &  0
  \end{pmatrix}
\right)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    v + h
  \end{pmatrix} \\
 & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    \partial_{\mu}
  \end{pmatrix}
  + \frac{gA_{\mu}^{1}}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    v+h \\
    0
  \end{pmatrix}
  - \frac{gA_{\mu}^{2}}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    v+h \\
    0 \\
    0
    \end{pmatrix} \\
 & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    g(v+h)A_{\mu}^{1} \\
    g(v+h)A_{\mu}^{2} \\
    \partial_{\mu}h
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent Therefore

\begin{equation}\label{eq:non_abelian_higgs_mechanism_covariant_derivative_sq}
|D_{\mu}\phi|^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}h\partial^{\mu}h +
\frac{g^{2}v^{2}}{2}\left( (A_{\mu}^{1})^{2} + (A_{\mu}^{2})^{2} \right) +
\frac{g^{2}}{2}(h^{2}+2hv)\left( (A_{\mu}^{1})^{2} + (A_{\mu}^{2})^{2} \right)
\end{equation}

\par This theory produces two massive bosons, $A_{\mu}^{1}$ and
$A_{\mu}^{2}$, both with mass, $m_{A} = gv$.  These fields have $h$,
and $h^2$ couplings to the Higgs boson.  The third guage field,
$A_{\mu}^{3}$, remains massles and is not coupled to the Higgs field.
This model is beginning to resemble a description of electroweak
physics, however, a third massive boson is necessary, as is a new
gague symmetry in order to generate it.  That is the subject of the
next section.  

\section{Glashow Weinberg Salam Theory}
\label{ewk_overview}

\par Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam published their theory unifying
elctromagnetic and weak forces in the
1960s~\cite{th:Weinberg_ModelOfLeptons}~\cite{th:Glashow_PartialSymmetries}~\cite{th:Salam_EWKInteractions}.
It begins with the requirement of a $SU(2)_{L}\otimes~U(1)$
symmetry and incorporates the Higgs mechanism to give mass to the guage bosons
of the weak force.  As described earlier, the $U(1)$ symmetry requires
introducing a vector field, which will be labeled $B_{\mu}$, and an interaction term, which
is absorbed into the covariant derivative, $D_{\mu}$.  The
transformation will also be paramaterized with a with a quantum
number, $Y$, known as hypercharge.  The $SU(2)$
symmetry requires the introduction of three new 
vector fields, which will be labeled $W_{\mu}^{i}, i = 1, 2, 3$.  The
quantum number associated with this gauge group is known as isospin,
and is determined by the $T^{3}$ operator, acting on an $SU(2)$
doublet on the third generator of the group. The $SU(2)\otimes~U(1)$
transformation, $U(x)$, will then be give by:   

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_su2_su1_transformation}
U(x) = e^{i\alpha^{a}(x)\tau^{a}}e^{iY\alpha(x)/}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\tau^{a} = \sigma^{a}/2$, the Pauli matrices,
\ref{eq:pauli_matrices}.  These gauge fields will be coupled, via the
covariant derivative, to a doublet of complex scalar fields $\phi$,
with hypercharge $Y=+1/2$.  A Higgs potential will be added to 
generate the spontaneous symmetry breaking that will give mass to
three of the guage fields, and leave one massless.  In order to
preserve the $SU(2)_{L}\otimes~U(1)$ symmetry, the new covariant 
derivative will take the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_covariant_derivative}
D_{\mu} = (\partial_{\mu} - igW_{\mu}^{a}\tau^{a} -
\frac{i}{2}g'B_{\mu})
\end{equation}

\par The subscript L on $SU(2)_{L}$ refers to the experimental
results that the weak force violates parity maximally, by only
interacting with the left-handed chiral component of a field.  Right
versus left chiralty is determined by whether the spin of a particle
is aligned or anti-aligned with its direction of motion, and in
general a particle is represented by a linear combination of its right and
left handed components.  This idea was first proposed by Chen Ning
Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, in the 1950s.  Their ideas were validated by
the experimental discovery of partiy violation in 1957, through the beta decays of Cobalt
60 atoms by C.S Wu.  That same year, Yang and Lee were awrded the
nobel prize for their insight~\cite{th:YangLee_NobelPrize}.  In this
model, then, the left-handed components of the particles participate
in the weak interaction and are formed into doublets, while the right handed
components are singlets, and will only interact with the
electromagnetic field, $B_{\mu}$.  The quantum numbers of the doublet
will be given by +1/2 for the upper component of the $SU(2)$ doublet,
and -1/2 for the lower component.  The fermion content of this theory
is then given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_fermion_doublets}
\begin{aligned}
&\binom{\nu_{L}}{e_{L}}, e_{R} \\
&\binom{u_{L}}{d_{L}}, u_{R}, d_{R} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the right handed neutrino, $\nu_{R}$ has been ommited,
since it has zero charge, and isospin, and therefore does not
participate in any of the interactions of this theory.  The complete
Lagrangian is given by a sum of free particle terms for  massless bosons,
fermions, and Higgs scalar fields; the Higgs potential; and a Yukawa
coupling term between the fermions and the Higgs, which generates
their masses. 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_lagrangian_simple}
\mathcal{L}_{GWS} = \mathcal{L}_{Boson KE} + \mathcal{L}_{Higgs} +
\mathcal{L}_{Fermion KE} + \mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} 
\end{equation}

\noindent The Higgs potential will have the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_higgs_lagrangian_term}
\mathcal{L}_{Higgs} = (D_{\mu}\phi)^{\dagger}(D^{\mu}\phi)
+\mu^{2}\phi^{\dagger}\phi - \lambda(\phi^{\dagger}\phi)^{2}
\end{equation}

\noindent The Higgs potential will break the symmetry of
the Lagrangian when one of the four degrees of freedom in the
complex scalar doublet, $\phi$, spontaneously acquires a
vacuum expectation value.  In this case, it will generate
three massive gauge bosons, one massless gauge boson, and a massive
scalar field.  After gaining a vacuum expectation value, and expanding
about this value, the scalar fields will have the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_phi_vev}
\langle\phi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\binom{0}{v+h}
\end{equation}

\noindent where no loss of generality has occured since we are always
able to rotate into this form through the appropriate gauge
transformations, similar to what was descibed in the Abelian case.  It
should also be noted that this form is not invariant to any of the
individual generators $t^{a}$, however $\phi$ will be invariant to a
combination of $T^{3}+Y$ generators.  Per Goldstone's thereom, we
should expect this linear combination of fields to be the massless
vector boson after symemtry breaking.  The massless eigenstate will be
the electromagnetic field, $A_{\mu} \sim~A_{\mu}^{3} + B_{\mu}$.  The
electric charge quantum number, $Q$, is then defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{ewk_Q_quantum_number}
Q = T^{3}+Y
\end{equation}

\par As before, the generation of the masses for the guage bosons are
generated by the interaction of their fields with the Higgs field via
the covariant derivative.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_covariant_derivative_acting_on_phi}
\begin{aligned}
D_{\mu}\phi & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \partial_{\mu}
  - \frac{ig}{2}A_{\mu}^{1} 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  &  1 \\
    1  &  0
  \end{pmatrix}
  - \frac{ig}{2}A_{\mu}^{2} 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0  & -i \\
    i  &  0
  \end{pmatrix}
  - \frac{ig}{2}A_{\mu}^{3} 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1  &   0 \\
    0  & -1
  \end{pmatrix}
\right)\binom{0}{v+h} \\ \\
& = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\binom{(\frac{g}{2}(v+h)A_{\mu}^{2}) +
  i(\frac{g}{2}(v+h)A_{\mu}^{1})}{\partial_{\mu} +
  i(\frac{1}{2}(v+h)(gA_{\mu}^{3}-g'B_{\mu}))}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent Taking the dot product of this with its hermitian conjugate
gives the $|D_{\mu}\phi|^{2}$ term:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_partial_phi_squared}
\begin{aligned}
|D_{\mu}\phi|^{2} = & \frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}h\partial^{\mu}h +
\frac{1}{2}\frac{g^{2}v^{2}}{4}( (A_{\mu}^{1})^{2} + (A_{\mu}^{2})^{2}
) +\frac{v^{2}}{4}(gA_{\mu}^{3}-g'B_{\mu})^{2}  \\
 & + \frac{1}{2}{g^{2}}{4}(h^{2}+2vh)( (A_{\mu}^{1})^{2} +
 (A_{\mu}^{2})^{2} ) +
 \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{4}(h^{2}+2vh)(gA_{\mu}^{3}-g'B_{\mu}) 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent From equation~\ref{eq:ewk_partial_phi_squared} we
can identify three massive and one massless guage bosons,
corresponding the the charged and nuetral weak currents, and the
elctromagnetic current.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_boson_masses}
\begin{aligned}
W_{\mu}^{\pm} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(A_{\mu}^{1} \mp iA_{\mu}^{2}) 
&\text{  with mass  }  m_{W} &= g\frac{v}{2}\text{;} \\
Z_{\mu}^{0} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g^{2}+g'^{2}}}(gW_{\mu}^{3}-g'B_{\mu})  
&\text{  with mass  }  m_{Z} &= \frac{v}{2}\sqrt{g^{2}+g'^{2}}\text{;}  \\
A_{\mu} & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{g^{2}+g'^{2}}}(gW_{\mu}^{3}+g'B_{\mu}) 
&\text{  with mass  }  m_{A} &= 0 \text{;} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the last field, $A_{\mu}$ is absent from the covariant
derivative term, but already identified as the massless gauge boson of
the theory due to it's gauge invariance under a $T^{3}+Y$ rotation.
Using these definitions the covariant derivative has the following
form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_covariant_derivative_mass_eigenstates}
\begin{aligned}
D_{\mu} & = \partial_{\mu} - \frac{ig}{\sqrt{2}}(W^{+}T^{+} + W^{-}T^{-}) \\
  &  - \frac{i}{\sqrt{g^{2}+g'^{2}}}Z_{\mu}^{0}(gT^{3} - g'Y) -
    \frac{gg'}{\sqrt{g^{2}+g'^{2}}}A_{\mu}(T^{3}+Y) 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 

\noindent where $T^{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma^{1}\pm\sigma^{2})$.  From
this form, we can identiy the fundamental electric charge, $e$, as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_electric_charge}
e = \frac{gg'}{\sqrt{g^{2}+g'^{2}}}
\end{equation}

The similarity in the forms between $Z_{\mu}^{0}$ and $A_{\mu}$
suggest that their relationship can be expressed in a simpler form, as
the rotation of underlying guage fields $A_{\mu}^{3}$ and $B_{\mu}$
through the weak mixing angle, $\theta_{W}$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:weak_mixing_matrix}
\binom{Z_{\mu}^{0}}{A_{\mu}} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
    \cos{\theta_{W}} & -\sin{\theta_{W}} \\
    \sin{\theta_{W}}  &  \cos{\theta_{W}}
  \end{pmatrix}
\binom{A_{\mu}^{3}}{B_{\mu}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\tan{\theta_{W}} = \frac{g'}{g}$.  Expanding
\ref{eq:weak_mixing_matrix}, we have the definitions of the
$Z_{\mu}^{0}$ and $A_{\mu}$ fields in terms of $\theta_{W}$

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_Z_A_defined_with_thetaW}
\begin{aligned}
Z_{\mu}^{0} &= A_{\mu}^{3}\cos{\theta_{W}} - B_{\mu}\sin{\theta_{W}}
\\
A_{\mu} & = A_{\mu}^{3}\sin{\theta_{W}} + B_{\mu}\cos{\theta_{W}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent The weak mixing angle, $\theta_{W}$, also provides a
simple relationship between the $W_{\mu}^{\pm}$ and $Z_{\mu}^{0}$
fields:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_mz_is_mwcosthetaW}
m_{W} = m_{Z}\cos{\theta_{W}}
\end{equation}

\noindent The covariant derivative, $D_{\mu}$ is also rewritten in
terms of the mass eignenstates of the gauge fields

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_covariant_derivative_mass_eigenstates}
D_{\mu} = (\partial_{\mu} - \frac{ig}{\sqrt{2}}(W_{\mu}^{+} +
W_{\mu}^{-}T^{-}) -
\frac{ig}{\cos{\theta_{W}}}Z_{\mu}^{0}(T_{3}-sin^{2}{\theta_{W}}Q) -
ieA_{\mu}Q)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $g = e/\cos{\theta_{W}}$.  The square of the covariant
derivative is then written as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_covariant_derivative_squared_mass_eigenstates}
\begin{aligned}
|D_{\mu}|^{2} &= \frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}h\partial^{\mu}h +
\frac{1}{2}m_{W}^{2}W_{\mu}^{+}W^{\mu+} +
\frac{1}{2}m_{W}^{2}W_{\mu}^{-}W^{\mu-} +
\frac{1}{2}m_{Z}^{2}Z_{\mu}^{0}Z^{\mu0} \\
& + (\frac{h^{2}}{v^{2}} + \frac{h}{v})[
    \frac{1}{2}m_{W}^{2}(W_{\mu}^{+}W^{\mu+}+W_{\mu}^{-}W^{\mu-}) +
    \frac{1}{2}m_{Z}^{2}Z_{\mu}^{0}Z^{\mu0}]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
\\
\par With the form of the covariant derivative in place, the
fermionic kinematic term of the Lagrangian can be described.  As
mentioned earlier, the masses of the fermions in the model will be
generated by the Yukawa interaction term with the Higgs, so this
term only involves the covariant derivatives acting on the left-handed
doublet and right-handed singlet states of this model.

\end{table} 

\noindent The quantum number assignments for the leptons, which are
chosen in order to reproduce the known values of their electric
charges, are shown in table~\ref{tab:ewk_fermion_quantum_numbers}.
The values  of these quantum numbers enter into the covariant
derivative via the  $Z_{\mu}^{0}$ term of equation
\ref{eq:ewk_covariant_derivative_mass_eigenstates}.  The fermionic
kinetic energy term of the Lagrangian is given by:

shows its explicit coupling to the guage boson fields.

\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent All of the terms will be combined with the final,
spontaneously broken GWS Lagranian at the end of this section.  

\par The final term to discuss in the theory, before combing all of
the results, is the Yukawa interaction term between the fermion fields
and the Higgs.  For the electron, this term takes the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_yukawa}
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa} =&~ -\lambda_{e}\bar{E_{L}}\cdot\phi~e_{R} -
\lambda_{e}E_{L}\cdot\phi~\bar{e_{R}} \\
=&~ -\frac{\lambda_{e}}{\sqrt{2}}(v+h)(\bar{e_{L}}e_{R} +
  e_{L}\bar{e_{R}}) \\
=&~ --\frac{\lambda_{e}v}{\sqrt{2}}(\bar{e_{L}}e_{R} +
  e_{L}\bar{e_{R}}) + -\frac{\lambda_{e}}{\sqrt{2}}(\bar{e_{L}}e_{R} +
  e_{L}\bar{e_{R}})h
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the mass of the electron is identified as $m_{e} =
\frac{\lambda_{e}v}{\sqrt{2}}$.  In order to generate the masses of
the particles, each fermion has its own unique $\lambda$ value.  So
while the Higgs mechanism is able to generate the masses in a way that
preserves the underlying $SU(2)\otimes~U(1)$ symmetry, it does not
explain the heirarchy of masses since each $\lambda$ value is unique
to each lepton.  The second term in last equation of
~\ref{eq:ewk_yukawa} is the coupling of the Higgs particle, $h$, to
the fermions.  The coupling is proportional to the mass of the
particle.  The largest of these is to the top quark, with $m_{t} =
73.21 \pm 0.51 \pm 0.71 GeV$.

\par The Yuakawa coupling for the quarks is necessarily modified when
additional quarks besides the $u$ and $d$ are added to the theory.
This is because there can be additional coupling terms that mix
generations.  This occurs when the mass eigenstate of the quarks is
not the same as the interaction eigenstate.  The modification requires
the expansion of the $u_{L}$ and $d_{L}$ components into a vector of
left handed quarks.  If we let

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_quark_vector}
\begin{aligned}
u_{L}^{i} = (u_{L}, c_{L}, t_{L}) &,                 & d_{L}^{i} = (d_{L}, s_{L}, b_{L})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent represent the up and down-type quarks in the orginal weak
interaction basis, then the vectors, $u_{L}^{i}$' and $d_{L}^{i}$',
can be defined as the diagonlized basis for the Higgs coupling.  They
are related through a unitary transformation.  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_quark_transformaitons}
\begin{aligned}
u_{L}^{i} = U_{u}^{ij}u_{L}^{j\prime} &,                 & d_{L}^{i} = U_{d}^{ij}d_{L}^{j\prime}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent The interaction terms with the charged gauge boson currents
must then be rewritten as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_ckm_intro}
J_{W}^{\mu+} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{u_{L}^{i}}\gamma^{\mu}d_{L}^{i}
=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{u_{L}^{i\prime}}\gamma^{\mu}(U_{u}^{\dagger}U_{d})d_{L}^{j\prime}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{u_{L}^{i\prime}}\gamma^{\mu}V_{ij}d_{L}^{j\prime}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $V_{ij}$ is the 3x3 Cobibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix
describing the mixing among six
quarks~\cite{th:CKM_matrix_C}~\cite{th:CKM_matrix_KM}.  It is an
extension of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiaini mechanism, which was a 2x2
matrix that predicted the existence of a fourth quark, the charm quark.  The GIM
mechanism was an attempt to suppress flavor-changing-neutral currents,
which occur at LO in a three-quark model, but not in a four-quark
model.  The CKM matrix, however, was motivated by an attempt to
explain $CP$ violation in the weak interaction.  At the time of its
publication, the bottom and top quarks were not predicted.  After
these were discovered, they were awarded the nobel prize in physics in
2008.  

\par At this point, all the of the pieces are ready to write down the
GWS Lagrangian, after the Higgs mechanism has spontaneously broken the
$SU(2)\otimes~U(1)$ symmetry.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ewk_lagrangian_unbroken}
\begin{aligned}

\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
\label{standard_model_overview}

\par The Standard Model of particle physics, extends the GWS model by
incorporating the QCD interaction between the quarks and gluons.  The
symmetry of this theory is that of:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sm_symmetry}
SU(3)_{C}\otimes~SU(2)_{L}\otimes~U(1)_{\gamma}
\end{equation}

\noindent The Lagrangian of the model is given by 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sm_lagrangian}
\mathcal{L}_{SM} = \mathcal{L}_{GWS} -
\frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}^{a}G^{a\mu\nu} + g_{S}C_{\mu}^{a}J_{QCD}^{a\mu}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the current for the QCD interaction, $J_{QCD}^{a\mu}$
is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sm_qcd_current}
J_{QCD}^{a} = \bar{u^{i}}\gamma^{\mu}t^{a}u^{i} + \bar{d^{i}}\gamma^{\mu}t^{a}d^{i}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $t^{a}$ are the Gell-Mann matrices defined in equation
\ref{eq:gell_man_matrices}.  The field strength tensor for the eight gluon fields,
$G_{\mu\nu}^{a}$, is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sm_gluon_field_strength_tensor}
G_{\mu\nu}^{a} = (\partial_{\mu}C_{\nu}^{a}
- \partial_{\nu}C_{\mu}^{a}) - g_{S}f^{abc}C_{\mu}^{b}C_{\mu}^{c}  
\end{equation} 

\par The experimental evidence in favor of the SM is compelling.
It has not only been able to describe existing phenomenon to great
precision, but has also predicted the existence of new forms of matter
and interactions among fundamental particles.  The
UA1~\cite{ex:UA1_W}~\cite{ex:UA1_Z} and UA2~\cite{ex:UA2_W}~\cite{ex:UA2_Z}
experiments at CERN, under the leadership of Carlo Rubbia, discovered
the $W$ and $Z$ bosons in 1983.  The experiments observed a handful of
events, in $p\bar{b}$ collisions, at $\sqrt{s}=540\GeV$, and were able
to measure the masses to be $M_{W}\sim~80\GeV$ and
$M_{Z}\sim~95\GeV$.  

\par In the following years, from 1989-2000, the Large
electron-positron (LEP) collider at CERN conducted precision measurments of
the Standard Model~\cite{ex:LEP_Z-Pole}~\cite{ex:LEP-2_W}.  Along with
high-precision measurements on on the $W,Z$ masses:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lep_WZ_masses}
\begin{aligned}
m_{Z} =&~ 91.1875 \pm 0.0021\GeV \\
m_{W} =&~ 80.376 \pm 0.0033\GeV 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}  

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Experimental_Results/Nnu.eps}
  \caption{Experimental results of the width of $Z$ boson from LEP, comparing the hypotheses of
    2, 3, or 4 neutrino generations} \label{fig:lep_Z_3_families}
\end{figure}

\noindent the experiment was also able to put stringent limits on the
existence of more than three families of leptons and quarks by
measuring the width of the $Z$ boson.  Figure
\ref{fig:lep_Z_3_families} shows the comparison of two, three, and
four family hypotheses to data.

  \caption{Recent experimental results of the top mass from the CDF detector at the Tevatron} \label{fig:topMass_CDF}
\end{figure}

\par Another milestone for the Standard Model occured in 1995 when the
CDF~\cite{ex:CDF_topQuark} and D0 experiments~\cite{ex:D0_topQuark} at
the Tevatron announced the observation of the top quark, with
$m_{t}\sim~176~\GeV$, in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.8~\TeV$.
Figure \ref{fig:topMass_CDF} shows a plot from 2012, the latest top quark mass measurements
from CDF, which reports a $m_{t} = 173.18 \pm 0.56 \pm 0.75~\GeV$. It was the  
last quark predicted by the CKM matrix to be observed, and earned
Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa the nobel prize in 2008 for
their work extending the quark sector to three families and
parameterizing their electroweak mixing.

  \caption{Recent experimental results of the Higgs mass from the CMS detector at the LHC} \label{fig:topMass_CDF}
\end{figure}

\par Yet another milestone was reached in 2012, when the CMS and ATLAS
detectors at CERN anounced the observation of a new boson, with
characteristics strikingly similar to the elusive Higgs boson of the
SM.  Figure \ref{fig:topMass_CDF} shows the latest measurement results
on the mass from the $H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ and $H\rightarrow~ZZ$
channels, with a $m_{H} = 125.02 \pm 0.27 \pm 0.15$.  One of the most
important remaining goals is to measure the couplings of this new
boson to all of the other particles in the Standard Model.  Of
particular interest is the coupling to the top-quark, since it offers
the largest value of the Higgs Yukawa coupling to measure.  This
offers a test of the nature of the coupling, as well as a probe into
deviations from its value.

\end{figure}

\par The rest of the thesis will describe the search for Higgs
boson production in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, so it will be
useful to understand the production mechanisms for the Higgs in this
scenario.  At the LHC collision energies $7-14\TeV$, there are four
dominant production mechanisms that produce Higgs events: gluon-gluon
fusion (ggf), vector-boson fusion (vbf), associated production with
vector bosons (VH), and associated production with top-quark pairs (ttH).  Figure
\ref{fig:Higgs_XS_7-14TeV} shows the relative cross sections for each
of these mechanisms.
