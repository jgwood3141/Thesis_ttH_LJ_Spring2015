\chapter{The Large Hadron Collider}
\label{lhc_overview}

\par The \acrfull{lhc}, is a proton-proton collider operated by the \acrfull{cern}

\section{From a bottle of Hydrogen}
\label{from_a_bottle_of_H}

\par Our journey begins with a bottle of Hydrogen that is Attached
somewhere before being ionized and zipped up to the speed of light.  

\par Such humble beginnings for a tool that is to become the most
powerful probe of nature mankind has ever wielded.  

\section{Klystron}
\label{klystron_overview}

\par This is basically a giant microwave cavity that initially
accelerates the protons up to some speed.

\section{Something Comes Next}
\label{something_next}

\par Should really know more about how protons get up to these
speeds.  

\section{The Main Injector}
\label{main_injector_overview}

\par Then the protons come here and are injected into the \acrshort{lhc}

\section{The LHC Ring}
\label{lhc_ring_overview}

\par Big magnets, one blew up once, cryogens, vaccuum better than
space.  Cool.  

\section{Final Structure and Beam Spacing}

\par Bunch structure, talk about important parameters of the beam
