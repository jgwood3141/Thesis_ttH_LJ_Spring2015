\textbf{\Large Abstract}\\[0.25in]

This dissertation presents a search for evidence of new particle production in the two-photon, lepton, and $b$-jet final state in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy 8 TeV. The search is performed in the full 2012 dataset, a total integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.
